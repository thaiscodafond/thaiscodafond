### Hello there! 👋

I'm Thaïs, nearing the end of my studies at IMT Atlantique in Brest, France. Seeking a six-month internship from April 2024 onward, I'm eager to dive into the world of software development, whether it's abroad or in Paris.

- 🌱 My academic focus on distributed systems and parallel/concurrent computing, under my major "ILSD," has me captivated.
- 🔭 I'm passionately building my portfolio website using Angular and Node.js, extending my learning beyond the classroom.
- 💻 Within my studies, I'm deeply involved in two standout projects: a web quiz game utilizing Node.js & Python with rabbitmq for communication, and a Unity-based digital twin of a physical miniature factory sourced from Fischertechnik.
- 📘 Previously, I interned at Amundi, where I developed software for a web app that handled ESG KPIs in the realm of asset management.
- ⚡ A little fun fact about me: I'm a gym enthusiast aiming to conquer a semi-marathon in 2024! 🏋️‍♀️
